  <h1>PHP</h1>

  <h1>AngularJS</h1>
    If you want a consistent structured look and feel for the tables throughout the application, angular datatables would do the job. You can globally set options for the table across your application and locally override them when necessary.
The code is also clear and concise with a clear definition of the data field with the corresponding column name and properties. Having the column structure tied to the data field also makes it less error-prone to reordering them. Conditionally showing or hiding columns is also easier with this approach.
